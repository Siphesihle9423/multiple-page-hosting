    <p>
      A bagel is a bread roll originating in the Jewish communities of Poland.
      Bagels are traditionally made from yeasted wheat dough that is shaped by
      hand into a torus or ring, briefly boiled in water, and then baked. The
      result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes
      crisp exterior.
